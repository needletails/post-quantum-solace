/// A protocol that defines methods for receiving events related to messages and contacts.
///
/// This protocol provides a comprehensive interface for handling various events that occur
/// during the lifecycle of messages and contacts in the secure messaging system. It conforms
/// to `Sendable` to ensure thread safety in concurrent environments.
///
/// ## Event Categories
/// - **Message Events**: Creation, updates, and deletion of encrypted messages
/// - **Contact Events**: Contact lifecycle management and metadata changes
/// - **Communication Events**: Updates to communication channels and member management
///
/// ## Usage
/// Implement this protocol to receive real-time notifications about changes in the messaging
/// system. The protocol methods are called asynchronously and should handle events efficiently
/// to maintain system responsiveness.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
/// All methods in this protocol are marked as `async` and should be implemented to handle
/// concurrent access safely. The `Sendable` conformance ensures that implementations can be
/// safely used across different execution contexts.
