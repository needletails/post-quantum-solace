/// `TaskProcessor` manages the asynchronous execution of encryption and decryption tasks
/// using Double Ratchet and other cryptographic mechanisms. It handles inbound and outbound
/// messaging for sessions, including persistence, identity resolution, and communication state.
///
/// This actor uses custom executors to ensure cryptographic operations are performed serially
/// on dedicated queues, preventing timing attacks and maintaining security properties.
///
/// ## Key Features
/// - **Actor Isolation**: Uses Swift's actor model for thread-safe access to mutable state
/// - **Custom Executors**: Dedicated serial queues for cryptographic and key transport operations
/// - **Double Ratchet**: Implements secure messaging with post-quantum cryptography
/// - **Message Persistence**: Optional local storage of encrypted messages
/// - **Identity Management**: Automatic resolution and refresh of session identities
/// - **Job Queue**: Asynchronous task processing with proper sequencing
///
/// ## Concurrency Model
/// - All actor methods run on the actor's serial executor by default
/// - Cryptographic operations use `cryptoExecutor` (serial queue)
/// - Key transport operations use `keyTransportExecutor` (separate serial queue)
/// - External code can access async capabilities via `unownedExecutor`
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```swift
/// let processor = TaskProcessor(logger: customLogger)
/// try await processor.outboundTask(message, cache: cache, symmetricKey: key, ...)
/// ```
///
/// ## Security Considerations
/// - Cryptographic operations are performed on dedicated serial queues to prevent timing attacks
/// - Sensitive data is never logged or exposed in error messages
/// - Keys are managed securely and never persisted in plain text
/// - Message ordering is preserved to maintain cryptographic properties
/// - Actor isolation prevents concurrent access to mutable state

    // MARK: - Inbound Messaging

    /// Handles an inbound encrypted message by enqueuing it for decryption.
    ///
    /// This function receives an encrypted message from the transport layer and schedules
    /// it for decryption and processing by the job queue. The actual decryption and
    /// message handling is performed asynchronously by the job processor.
    ///
    /// ## Processing Pipeline
    /// 1. Message is received and wrapped in an `EncryptableTask`
    /// 2. Task is scheduled for processing by the job queue
    /// 3. Job processor decrypts the message using Double Ratchet
    /// 4. Message is validated and processed according to its type
    /// 5. Recipients are notified of the new message
    ///
    /// ## Security Features
    /// - Messages are processed in order to maintain cryptographic properties
    /// - Decryption is performed on dedicated cryptographic queues
    /// - Message validation prevents malicious content from being processed
    /// - Identity verification ensures messages come from known senders
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - message: The message received from the transport layer.
    ///     Contains the encrypted payload and sender metadata.
    ///   - session: The current crypto session used to decrypt and dispatch.
    ///     Provides the cryptographic context needed for decryption.
    /// - Throws: Errors from task scheduling or job queue management.
    ///   Decryption errors are handled by the job processor.
